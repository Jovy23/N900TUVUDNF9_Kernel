#Once kernel is compiled
make clean && make mrproper


#The following is needed when you do changes in arch/arm/mach-msm/boot/dts kernel source

#First make sure you got the device tree compiler installed
sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler

#Download mkbootimg-tools https://github.com/xiaolu/mkbootimg_tools
#Place "mkboot" shell script and the "dtbTool" executable in script folder

#Build dt.img (needed for overclocking)
./scripts/dtbTool -s 2048 -o arch/arm/boot/dt.img arch/arm/boot/

#Your zImage & dt.img will be in arch/arm/boot folder

#If having trouble compiling kernel you will have to change the "CROSS_COMPILE" path to where your toolchain is located on your ubuntu OS. Go into your kernel source and open up "Makefile". 

#Search for: 
CROSS_COMPILE ?= /opt/toolchains/arm-eabi-4.7/bin/arm-eabi-

#Since my ubuntu OS is named jovy23 and i have my toolchain located in a few folders here is how it looks like: NOTE: I renamed the linaro toolchain folder i have downloaded after unzipping the downloaded toolchain to linaro-gcc.

CROSS_COMPILE ?= /home/jovy23/android/toolchain/linaro-gcc/bin/arm-eabi-

#To get the toolchain go to (https://wiki.linaro.org/Cycles/1408/Release?action=show&redirect=Cycles%2FLatest%2FRelease) and look for "android-toolchain 4.9" under "ANDROID COMPONENTS". Note: My toolchain version is "4.9-2014.08".
